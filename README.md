MB ModestMap
============
This is a fork of the ActionScript 3 [Modest Map](http://modestmaps.com) api. I am converting it to an AIR libary that will support an MBTiles map provider. The MBTiles format is an open spec developed by [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com") that defines an efficient way to store raster tiles in an SQLite database. By storing map tiles locally, your maps can be accessible offline (without an internet connection) and can see a signifigant speed bost for the user experience.

The code is currently in development on the devel branch. Once a stable solution is implemented, I will merge the master branch and write more documentation on usage.
